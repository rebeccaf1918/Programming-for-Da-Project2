This repository contains my project in a Jupytr notebook format for the Programming for Data Analysis Module which forms part of the ATU Galway HDIP in Data Analytics.

This repository contains the research conducted 

_Technical Requirements_
To download this Project
Go to my repository on Github at 
From there, you can choose how to use the repository whether that is downloading it as a zipfile or cloning the repository.

_Requirements to run the code_
This code is written in Python programming language and there are a few requirments necessary for the operate of the project code.

# Project plan

- Download all required data sets including carbon, temperature, Mauna Loa Observatory data, add data on Polar Ice Coverage Irish data from Met Eireann
- Complete work on data to merge them and have correct format etc
- Create plots etc to analyse the created data set
- Download and sort Irish data sets
- Complete analysis on the Irish data
- Make predicts and come to conclustions on the future and complete regression on the data

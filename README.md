_Introduction_
This repository contains my project in a Jupytr notebook format for the Programming for Data Analysis Module which forms part of the ATU Galway HDIP in Data Analytics.

This repository contains the research conducted 

_Technical Requirements_
To download this Project
Go to my repository on Github at 
From there, you can choose how to use the repository whether that is downloading it as a zipfile or cloning the repository.

_Requirements to run the code_
This code is written in Python programming language and there are a few requirments necessary for the operate of the project code.

Install Python - latest version 3.11.0 (I recommend to install Anaconda with it for expanded programming capabilities)
Install the Visual Studio Code (or alternativly, your source code editor of preference)
Install Cmder (or alternatively, your command line interpreter of preference)
Install all the Python libraries required

# Project plan

- Download all required data sets including carbon, temperature, Mauna Loa Observatory data, add data on Polar Ice Coverage Irish data from Met Eireann
- Complete work on data to merge them and have correct format etc
- Create plots etc to analyse the created data set
- Download and sort Irish data sets
- Complete analysis on the Irish data
- Make predicts and come to conclustions on the future and complete regression on the data
